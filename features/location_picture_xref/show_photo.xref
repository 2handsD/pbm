Feature: Show Photos for Location
  In order to show photos at a location
  As a guest
  I want to be able to see photos at a location

  @javascript
  Scenario: Does not display photos that have not been approved
    Given there is a location machine xref
    And the following location picture xref exists:
      |id|location|approved|
      |1|name: Test Location Name|0|
      |2|name: Test Location Name|1|
    And I am on "Portland"'s home page
    And I press the "location" search button
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    Then I should see a thumbnail for photo "2"
    And I should not see a thumbnail for photo "1"
